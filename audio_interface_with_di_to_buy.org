#+title: audio interface with DI, to buy
* motivation
  Needed for the DI -- otherwise I can input signals and sum them to a zero-latency monitor at the same time.
* DONE : ordered one of these, <2024-12-02 Mon>
** ORDERED: looks like the winner
   8 channel, not pro, cheaper than the 6-channel

** Chinese, cheaper, might do all the same stuff

** One with separate gain and level controls per channel!
