** math
*** Look at the answer choices: If they’re far apart, you can estimate the answer.
*** Transferring numbers from screen to paper is hard.
    So don't try to merge that step with another.
*** subtraction can make an average calculation simpler
**** example
     mean [89, 94, 85, 90, x] = 90
     <=> mean [89,94,85,x] = 90
     <=> mean [4,9,0,y] = 5 -- subtracting 85 from both sides,
                            -- and defining x = 85 + y
	 = (13+y)/4
     <=> 20 = 13 + y
     <=> y = 7
     <=> x = 92
*** "range" of some numbers = min and max
*** "mode" = most frequent. Might be more than one.
*** median is sometimes the average of the two middle ones
    sometimes = when it's an even number of things
*** combinatorics
**** number of permutations of k members of a set of size n
     = n! / (n-k)!
     (permutation = order matters)
**** number of combinations of k members of a set of size n
     = n! / ( k! (n-k)! )
     (combination = order does not matter)
*** dumb counting > complex conditional probability math
**** q
     Of  the 12 applicants for a job, 6 have master’s degrees, 5 have tenure, and 4 have neither the
 degree nor the tenure. If one applicant is called at random, what is the probability that they
 have both a master’s degree and tenure
**** attempt 1, failed
     P1 = (2/3) = P(not someone with neither)
     P2 = (6/8) = P(master's conditional on P1)
     P3 = 5/8   = P(tenure   conditional on P1)
     So 2/3 * 6/8 * 5/8 =
	1/1 * 2/4 * 5/8 = 5/16
**** attempt 2
     Only 8 are of interest.
     Of them, 6 have one good thing, 5 have the other.
     So at most, 5 have both.
     But if 5 had both then 2 more in that group have neither!
     So that's not possible; everyone in that group needs at least one.
     Therefore of the two that don't have master's degrees,
     both must have tenure.
     That leaves only 3 with tenure to be among those with master's.
     So it's 3/12 = 1/4.
*** counting sets
**** formula for size of union
     the size of the union of A and B
     = size A + size B - size (intersect A B)
**** PITFALL: be literal about the wording
     e.g. I misinterpreted this
***** the question
      Of all the company employees, 60 took advantage of educational benefits, 145 participated in the company retirement program, and 40 participated in both programs. How many employees took advantage of at least one program?
***** my bad interpretation
      was that the three sets given were nonoverlapping
*** team work problems
**** the trick
     find an "accomplishment / person-hour" rate
     (and assume it stays constant)
**** an example
***** q
      800 fries in 16*3 kid-minutes
      so how many minutes for 400 fries among 12 kids?
***** answer
      800 / (16*3) = 400 / (12*x)
      2 *12*x = 16*3
      24x = 48
      x = 2
*** work rate problems
**** the kind of question
     If x works at a rate of R tasks / hour,
     and y works at rate S,
     -- and scaling is linear --
     then how fast do they work together?
**** two tricks
     First make sure I'm looking at tasks per hour,
     not hours per task. If the latter, reciprocate.
     Now I can just add:
     n tasks / hr + m tasks / hr = (n + m) tasks/hr
*** averages
**** If the terms are evenly spaced
     then the average is that of the first and last.
*** units problems
    It's usually one number times a rate times a lot of identities,
    where the identities are inverted or not
    according to the unit I want to end up with.
    For instance, if they want meters, I might do
      2 minutes * (15 km/hr) * (1 hr / 60 minutes) * (1000 m / km)
*** 120 inches is 10 feet, not 12.
*** when they talk about a shaded area
    be sure my colors are not inverted
*** don't forget parts of the question
    I was asked to subtract half a circle's area from a square's.
    I subtracted their areas but forgot the factor of 1/2.
*** The measure of an angle inscribed in a circle depends only on the two points away from it!
    and the formula is that the angle is equal to half the arc measure of the other two points.
    So for instance, if B and C are 90 degrees apart on the circle, and A is any other point outside of that 90 degree arc, then the angle BAC = 45 degrees.
*** Might approximate pi as 22/7.
*** A chord is any line across a circle.
*** Some common right triangles
**** 3 4 5
**** 5 12 13
**** 2 2 2*sqrt2
**** 1 root3 2
     This is half of an equilateraly triangle.
*** Don't wrongly assume they want decimal, closed form, etc.
    If it's multiple choice, check the answers to know that.
    This avoids some wasted time.
*** The length of the third side of a triangle is bounded
    by the sum and the difference of the other two.
*** Don't misread an 8 for a 0.
    This might just be something that happens in Emacs to me
    when doing math.
*** For polygons, angle total = (n-2) * 180
    Think "triangle, square, keep going."
*** Similar things can be different sizes. Congruent things can't.
*** "Vertical" angles are equal.
    Where two lines cross,
    two angles are "vertical" if they don't share a segment.
*** Complementary angles sum to 90, supplementary, to 180.
*** The circle equation
    (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = rr
    The center is (a,b).
    Notice the negative sign.
*** Don't pattern-match to the exclusion of reading every symbol.
    For instance, in looking for this:
      (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = rr
    I was fooled by an answer with the right a, and r,
    but it had a stray negative sign:
      (x-a)^2 - (y-b)^2 = rr
      .       ^
      .      here
*** Skipping a lot of steps in a rewrite is dangerous.
*** Use the Pythagorean Theorem to compute planar distance.
*** Careful with negative signs when rewriting equations.
*** If they talk about x and y, keep them straight!
*** (a + b) (a - b) = aa + bb
*** factor xx + ax + b
**** how
     (x + l) (x + m)
     where l*m = b and l+m = a
**** why
     If xx + ax + b = 0, factoring it lets you read off
     the two possible values of x.
**** example
     xx - 4x - 12 = 0
     (x - 6) (x + 2) = 0
     x = 6 or -2
     checking -2:
       2*2 + 4*2 - 12 = 4*3 - 12 = 0
**** xx + 2x = 15
     xx + 2x - 15 = 0
     (x - 3) (x + 5) = 0
*** sqrt(ab) = sqrt a * sqrt b
    so sqrt 300 = 10 * sqrt 3
*** sqrt(a/b) = sqrt a / sqrt b
*** (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
*** x^a * x^b = x^(a+b)
*** a^(-x) = 1/a^x
*** "units digit" = last digit in a number
    e.g. in 18 it is 8
*** remember to simplify diagonally across fractions when multiplying them
    e.g. (4/9) * (6/8)
       = (4/8) * (6/9)
       = (1/2) * (2/3)
*** dividing decimals
    Move the decimal point the same distance for each.
    e.g. 0.00x / 0.0y
         = x / 10*y
*** don't confuse percentages and fractions
*** 0! = 1
*** for unit conversion questions
    I imagine it usually starts as a multiplication,
    like "18 seconds * 25 mph".
    Then just multiply by identities.
*** Don’t try to check your work.
    It's slower than redoing it, because the math is always simple.
** about the app
*** I can guess and mark a question.

	 = 8
** 10 choose 3

   = 120
** adjusting the cost of a mixture via one ingredient

   40 * 30 + x * 80 = 40 * (40 + x)
   30 + 2x = 40 + x
   x = 10
** work rate problems

    So to mow one lawn they would take 10/7 hours
** averages

    needs a 95 on the 7th exam to get a 90
*** If 3 are 96 and the average is 95, what's the fourth?

    so 92
*** x = sum (5, 7, 8, x, 20, 21, 23) / 7

*** mostly formulaic

*** my clever way sucked
    I got this wrong somehow,
    writing 16 where I should have written 4*16 (now corrected)

    if they were radius 1 it would be
    4 - pi
    so scale that by 4^2:
    64 (1 - pi pi) = 64 - 16 pi
*** the obvious way
    square area = 64
    circle area = pi * 16
    so 64 - 16 pi
** square of side 4 - half of circle of radius 2
   = 16 - pi * 2^2 / 2
   = 16 - 2 pi
** Area of an eq. triangle with side length 8?
   split it in half, the short side is length 4,
   and the hypotenuse is length 8.
   64 = 16 + ss
   ss = sqrt 48 = just under 7
   So its area is just under 8*7/2 = 28.
   Oh they want a radical expression.
   So 4*sqrt 48 = 4 * sqrt(16 * 3) = 16 sqrt 3
** the interior angle at a line bisecting an equilateral octogon

*** essay
  Oversight of how people share information is, indeed, an important part of a mature society. It is, however, a delicate project, requiring a careful consideration of the costs and benefits to various populations of various forms of information, as well as the feasibility of controlling that information. (As I believe Richard Stallman said, information "wants to be free".)

  The motivation for controlling what information people are able to publish or find is straightforward. Society is clearly better off making certain kinds of facts difficult to obtain -- how to construct bioweapons, for instance -- because they pose a threat to others. Similarly, there exist forms of information that can be damaging to at least certain viewers, if not to those around them. Pornography or graphic violence, for instance, are widely believed to be best withheld from children. Hatred is another kind of information which we try to keep a lid on, because it seems possible to induce many people to do terrible things by making them hate another group. And last (that occurs to me), lies can be quite damaging -- for instance, that a vaccine will turn its recipients into crocodiles. (That particular lie might sound absurd but it did in fact spread in South America.)

  The difficulty lies in determining exactly how to control these forms of information. Totalitarian censorship can generate resentment of and mistrust in the authorities -- not just government or the press, but even the scientific method itself. It also can create a homogeneity of belief in the population that is not conducive to the search for truth.

  But there are two useful alternatives to outright bans on harmful information: contextualization and non-promotion. (Both have indeed been attempted on various social media platforms, and while their success has been mixed, they are widely considered valuable.) The context provided can range from something as simple as a label to the effect of "this content is controversial", to providing links to sources that disagree, to directly attaching (as X does today) contextualizing commentary provided by  peer users of the platform.

  Non-promotion is arguably less ethical, and certainly less transparent. It consists of the platform recognizing potentially harmful information (probably through the use of artificial intelligence) and responding by sharing the post with fewer people than it otherwise would -- in extreme cases, with nobody (a practice called "shadow-banning"). Such a practice risks alienating users, however, and leading them to seek a platform with fewer constraints on their behavior. It seems worth considering a practice in which users are actually informed of such treatment. I am unaware of cases in which this has been tried.

  I have focused on social media platforms because that is in practice where these choices are most at play today. In a free society, prohibiting what someone can say in private to someone else is simply not on the cards. But regarding mass media like television or books, much of the same reasoning applies.

  But these measures are to a large extent treating the symptoms rather than the cause of the problem. A well-educated, skeptical public, trained in critical reasoning, would need less if any of this kind of guidance, and would be more robust to whatever information circulated within it. That is the world I hope we move toward.
