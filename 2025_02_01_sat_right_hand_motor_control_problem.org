#+title: <2025-02-01 Sat> right hand motor control problem
* following up <2025-10-02 Thu>: 88 wpm
  https://monkeytype.com/
  I smoked weed yesterday but not today. Woke up 7 am. It's 10 now.
* following up Thursday: I don't think it was the weed.
  I smoked for a couple days yesterday and the day before, and didn't notice any such symptoms, and just now tested my typing speed at 66 wpm, which seems good.
* symptoms
  I definitely had trouble typing. I could think of the word and then my fingers would get stuck. I had to be more conscious of what they were doing in order to do things that used to not require that. I don't think I'm back to normal even now, like 90 minutes later.
* possible reasons
** big (for me) marijuana for two consecutive days
** low salt intake that day
   ate vegetarian all day without salt,
   after a couple days at Paipa eating way too much salt
