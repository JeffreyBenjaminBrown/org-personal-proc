*** ONGOING how much to use
**** by weight, <2026-01-20 Tue>
     N kg clothes => N/2 g detergent ("Vanish Oxi Action")
**** Trying <2025-01-14 Tue>:
    4 kg clothing to 1 smallest measuring spoon of detergent.
*** Goes in the big left compartment.
*** PITFALL: Requires moving "the selector".
**** PITFALL: It's finicky and (I think) delicate.
     Play around with horizontal pressures,
     not just vertical ones, to move it up or down.
**** where to put it
     It should be high for powder, low for liquid.
**** what it is
     A piece of plastic in the back of the compartment.
*** PITFALL: Use only high efficiency ("HE") detergent.
** bleach and softener have two more compartments.
* separate lint-givers and lint-takers
  Towels give lint.
  Synthetics, knits and corduroy take it.
