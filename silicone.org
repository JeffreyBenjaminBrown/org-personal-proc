  When I burned it it did flame, and self-extinguished quickly. I did not hold the flame to it long enough to get Ash. I can twist the hell out of it without leaving any noticeable effect in shape or color. I cannot meaningfully stretch it with my bare hands. Even cold it had a smell that I don't like. But after putting it in hot water it didn't really have much smell at all.
  I have noticed no degrading and no endogenous stickiness.
