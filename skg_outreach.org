** blurb
*** Skg is for knowledge. It lets you collect, organize, navigate (read), share and integrate knowledge across people. It expects user to colect knowledge; without that it is no use.
** The Skg README is clearer than my org-roam notes on Skg.
   https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/skg
   and might be the best introduction to Skg.
** names for it
*** "taag"
**** "Share and merge traversable writing, Traversable As A Graph."
** "Think of it like your third eye."
*** garden the best
**** Keep a garden of the thoughts so good you want to review them.
     Collect them.
     I'll try to make attribution easy.
     Even if it's not, whatever,
     collect them however you want.
*** Integrate your garden with someone else's.
**** The can build branches for you.
***** All you need to do is subscribe.
**** Subscription is fine-grained.

*** Mindmapping is opposite to academia.
    It is thinking without specialization, with complete freedom.
*** Mindmapping can look distant from work.
    Thinking about a lot of things you can't change can look impractical. The change is in you.

*** explain how to read a tree
    Each node is about the parent.
    Like how chapter titles relate to book titles --
    it's not fixed, everyone's work is different.
    But you can make a simple sentence involving the two.
*** Each note is a collection of notes.
*** Containment and hyperlinks are different.
    A context is a note contained in no other note.
    But a context, like any other note, can be linked to.
*** public privacy and private privacy
    The user can insert a link to a private file anywhere, and the link might be public or not. When not, it is instead part of a corresponding file in their private repository, which refers to the public repository context that it modifies.ost.
** It is a programmable graph.
*** trees with multiple kinds(make your own!) of edges
** Justify the one-file-per-node format.
*** subscriptions are small
*** diffs are readable
** big missions
*** ternary relationships
** Half Baked Digital offered to share Skg.

** evangelism
*** If you feel special and want more you should want skg.
    read as a whole; the last is conclusion
**** Do yuo feel smarter than others?
**** Do you believe you could write
     down a good fraction of the ideas responsible for the difference?
**** Do you believe if others did it could make you far more powerful?
*** Just show mindmapping working. Youtube.
** Share Skg to everyone who uses those tools.
   TypeDB, Rust, Emacs

    No need to look at diffs to think about sharing.
*** Child content stored separately from child position.
*** Subscriptions can be public and private.
*** Unsubscriptions could I think be public and private.
    The trick: In a public context the privately unsubscribed-from nodes should not show up.
*** Public subscriptions to private nodes reveal almost nothing.
    They reveal the fact of their existence,
    but not what they unsubscribe to -- not even its repo.

* Fun-looking screenshots of mindmapping.
** TODO This will require osc-gen.
** AWESOME what makes a good one
   A taste for completeness is like poetry.
   Give context in the most intriguing directions.
   A balance of concise categories and complete sentence leaves.
   An image bigger than I can see all of due to font size is fine, and maybe never necessary.

I feel like I've hardly earned the right to speak here but I wonder what any of you giants would think (the README is 763 words) of a much simpler knowledge graph app with a novel sharing mechanism?
* letters
** letter: "My app needs your recommendation."
 Dear Sam Harris or anyone with similar concerns,

 I am building something for informational justice and creativity. It is a simple novel writing and sharing algorithm with societal implications.

 I ask something, your word, which is cheap and powerful specifically for someone of your interests and fame. I ask your word that the app would help with the above concerns. I would thank you publicly.

 I am making the app Skg for it and need help. People who care about what you care about might be able to help me build it if you asked.

 Please read about it.

 Sincerely,
 Jeff
