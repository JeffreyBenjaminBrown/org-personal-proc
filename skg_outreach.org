* Ask HN is anyone trying to map the space of all ideas top down? And bottom up at the same time?
** Let us merge our thoughts.

* caveat to screenshots
  Mindmapping is opposite to academia. It is thinking without specialization, with complete freedom. It looks insane.
* Fun-looking screenshots of mindmapping.
** TODO This will require osc-gen.
** AWESOME what makes a good one
   A taste for completeness is like poetry.
   Give context in the most intriguing directions.
   A balance of concise categories and complete sentence leaves.
   An image bigger than I can see all of due to font size is fine, and maybe never necessary.

* consider different use cases
** teamwork
** education
* AI can help understand cryptic notes
  they come with graph context
* things to say in the docs
** Your accumulated wisdom is far greater than your insights right now.
** Address Jamie and Ellen's concerns of why should I write
** Please recommend, if you believe it has potential, programmers who share your concerns to contribute to my software project.
** Spaced repetition audience shout out
** cite living people

I feel like I've hardly earned the right to speak here but I wonder what any of you giants would think (the README is 763 words) of a much simpler knowledge graph app with a novel sharing mechanism?

** letter: "My app needs your recommendation."
 Dear Sam Harris or anyone with similar concerns,

 I am building something for informational justice and creativity. It is a simple novel writing and sharing algorithm with societal implications.

 I ask something, your word, which is cheap and powerful specifically for someone of your interests and fame. I ask your word that the app would help with the above concerns. I would thank you publicly.

 I am making the app Skg for it and need help. People who care about what you care about might be able to help me build it if you asked.

 Please read about it.

 Sincerely,
 Jeff
