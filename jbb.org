# A sidenote: Is this a known bug?

I ran `fdisk -l` and found that the drive I wanted to target was at `/dev/sdb`. I ran this:
```
sudo dd bs=4M                                                  \
  if=nixos-graphical-19.03.173549.ebdc4419310-x86_64-linux.iso \
  of=/dev/sdb
```

While it was running I ran `fdisk -l` again, I don't remember why. That hanged. I killed it. I found the `dd` process had also hanged, so I killed it. I tried running the same command a couple more times; it always hanged.

Next thing I knew I had overwritten the *other* two USB devices with the NixOS image.
