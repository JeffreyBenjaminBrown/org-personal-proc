** [[id:6172961e-c3f4-4fc2-88d5-427daabac99b][Give travel gifts immediately.]]
** Buy insurance for instruments well ahead of time.
** Don't keep multiple packing lists|recipes.
*** what to do
    Keep the master one,
    and tailor a clone of it to whatever my latest trip is.
    Discard the clone once the trip is done,
    merging relevant changes into this master recipe.
*** why
    I used to keep a "short trips" list,
    and it diverged from master, which created problems.
** Be sure travel change announcements reach me
   and not, say, Ellen's cell
   (despite MSU FCU relying on it).
** Buy luggage early.
   The price rises.
* *way earlier*
** buy gifts
** Keep frequent flyer creds on phone, for wifi
