#+title: umbrella, small & wide, buy
To comfortably fit two people, really need a 60" width (which means about 70" measuring along the fabric, as product descriptions seem to do).

To fit vertically in my backpack, needs about 17" max folded length.

On Amazon I found nothing that even matches those two criteria, regardless of price. I looked for maybe 20 minutes.
