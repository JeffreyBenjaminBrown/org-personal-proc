We use this law firm for the church
Maybe that's why the price was good

** Jeremy says
Expat Group online is also pretty ok for other visa issues - Christian Alcocer used them before but without getting rejections or whatever
Google it - they are based in Medellin but do a lot of online consultancy and can do the whole process too
We got advice from them once or twice
$60 for 30 minute consultation
