* whatsapp message plans
- deal with Whatsapp micropayments
- Automate Whatsapp group creation
  - and handing control of each group to a volunteer? or does nobody control the group?
- Run a server
- keep a database of volunteers
  - keep location, phone number, interests, running count of converts
- suggest groups to each convert
  - suggest more than one, describing their interests?
  - permit choosing more than one?
- Provide unique links to each visitor, to provide their converts
- Update the database each time a new user visits
* DONE what to survey
** Ooh and instead of letting someone answer none to the "problems with LC" we could put, "I love him too much." Or perhaps funnier, "mi pareja le ama demasiado."
** a trick
   I've mostly gathered the issues below from the survey. But I haven't framed them as "what do you like about LC" -- that seems ridiculous. Rather I've framed them as "what do you care about".
** values for the country
   adjectives not necessary -- e.g. "salud" > "salud digna y oportunia"
*** salud
*** empleo
*** educación
*** productividad y crecimiento
*** responsabilidad fiscal
*** equidad
*** cumplimiento con la ley
*** seguridad
*** trámites eficientes
*** reglas claras, inc. de tributación
*** contratación eficiente
*** costo de vivienda
*** bajar impuestos
*** cuidar a la juventud
*** cuidar a la gente mayor
*** cuidar a la gente con discapacidades
*** cuidar a las pequeñas empresas
*** certeza macroeconómica
*** cuidar el ambiente
** values in a politician
*** listen
*** study
*** speaks simply, clearly
*** cautious
*** stern ("mano firme")
*** ethical (and independent?)
*** courage
*** visible data
*** visible decision process
*** reward merit over connections
*** empathy
*** humility
*** realism
*** optimism
*** cooperative
*** stubborn?
    some people value that, I think. ("conviction")
*** inclusive
*** servicial
*** humor?
** what part of LC's background do you like most
   Good to know when writing speeches.
** what about him do you like least?
   Would this be useful to know? Would it be a good move in terms of voter sentiment? I feel like it could generate goodwill.
*** too technical
*** too optimistic
*** speaks too fast
*** too many videos
*** his sweaters are too fancy
*** his ears are too big

** article

** the idea
People signing up at Hernandez's website would describe themselves,
and the system would give them a link
to a local WhatsApp group for supporter.
They could recruit more people and ascend the ranks.
High-ranking people in the pyramid
won titles, video messages from Hernandez,
maybe more access,
maybe the offer of appointee positions,
maybe (but how? I may have misunderstood)
  their own electoral candidacies.
** my feedback to LCR
*** It's a brilliant idea.
*** I can't tell if it's evil.
*** That each member gathers 10 votes seems optimistic. Do you know how those numbers panned out?
*** Do I understand right that part of the appeal was that if you rise in the ranks you might get your own political position? As an appointee? As an electoral candidate?
** I am unable to impugn its ethics.
   Part of me recoils at the term multilevel marketing, but there's no sense in which the pyramid scheme screws the base of the pyramid.
   Another recoils at the idea of technological opacity -- nobody but the members can see what they're saying. But what am I, against freedom of assembly?
* TODO Next in CiviCRM
** make two pages, with text and hyperlinks
** a website where you can fill out a form
** work with the db
* TODO Watch LC's X feed, and TikTok
  they have distinct content

*** Yet she thought he was smart, and wanted him to win.
** Someone didn't like his sweater.
   This person thought LCR did not seem approachable -- despite knowing he can be, having seen him be so with students.
   Thought the sweater was too posh. He seems elite and showy.

Make it clear how to go.
Add (maybe after they respond) that sharing the invite would help too.
