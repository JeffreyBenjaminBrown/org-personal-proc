#+title: Private equity ... sucks?
* ask 1
  Alex Falcone describes the (private equity, bankruptcy)
  sequence as the private equiatist (is that a word?)
  pay the business for the privilege of making it go bankrupt,
  which somehow also makes the PE money.
  Is that right? How can that work?
* (read claude)
* ask 2
  Do all the debts get paid off?
