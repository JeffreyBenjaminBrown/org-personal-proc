    I paid it before Sandy sent me the bill,
    on <2023-12-20 Wed>.
    It was about 46e3 COP.
*** mortgage
*** (Done I think?) Paulo VI admin fee
    Normally I pay Paulo VI 250e3-ish every month around the 10th.
    This month they billed for the electrical closet repair,
    and I paid 2.6e6-ish on Dec 2.
    The bill looked very similar to previous ones,
    so I'm guessing it included the regular admin fee.
    I checked on <2023-12-18 Mon>
    and again now, <2023-12-22 Fri>,
    and the Mi Pago Amigo website
    says the bill is paid, but doesn't specify the month.
